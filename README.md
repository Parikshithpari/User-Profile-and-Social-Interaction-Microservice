# User-Profile-and-Social-Interaction-Microservice
This Spring Boot microservice enables user profile creation and follow/unfollow functionality in a modular microservice-based system. Designed for social platforms or any application requiring user interactions, it depends on a separate user registration service for authentication and basic user data retrieval.


# üß™ User Profile Service & Controller Test Suite

This test suite ensures robust behavior for core functionalities in the `UserService` and `UserController` layers of a Spring Boot application managing user profiles and social features (e.g., follow/unfollow).
